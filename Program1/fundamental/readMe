Introduction to C programming language

C is a middile level language which was originated in the 197's

Advantage of a middle level language:
- They can act as a bridge as a high level software and a low level hardware.
- most compilers, kernels and operating system are written in C.
- C is the mother language of python, java, C#, C++ and jaascript

Note:
- C is not an object oriented language
- C++ is an extension of C
- C is difficult

what do you need to start C
- IDE(Text Editor)
- GCC compiler(it convert C code to machine codes)

For extention:
- Install C/C++
- Code runner

you should start with this on your environment before coding
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdbool.h> - boolean
#include<string.h> - eleminate white space
#include<math.h> - arithmetics
#include <ctype.h>- changing the string to uppercase or lowaercase
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>

vairable:

it is an allocated space to store variable.
steps: declerations and initialization.

There are 4 primary date types in C program

1. Integer – We use these for storing various whole numbers, such as 5, 8, 67, 2390, etc.

2. Character – It refers to all ASCII character sets as well as the single alphabets, such as ‘x’, ‘Y’, etc.

3. Double – These include all large types of numeric values that do not come under either floating-point data type or integer data type.

4. Floating-point – These refer to all the real number values or decimal points, such as 40.1, 820.673, 5.9, etc.

5. Void – This term refers to no values at all. We mostly use this data type when defining the functions in a program.

Various keywords are used in a program for specifying the data types mentioned above. Here are the keywords that we use:

Keyword Used	Data Type
int	            Integer
float	        Floating-point
void	        Void
char	        Character
double	        Double

Other data types:
bool            boolean

Format Specifier %:
Defines and formats a type of data to be displayed

Constant: it is a fixed value that cannot be altered by the program during its execution

Arithmetic operator:
Operator	Meaning of Operator
+	        addition or unary plus
-	        subtraction or unary minus
*	        multiplication
/	        division
%	        remainder after division (modulo division)
--          decrement
++          increment

Augumented assignment: it is used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable. e.g x= x+1, x+=1

If-else statetement: The if-else statement in C is used to perform the operations based on some specific condition. The operations specified in if block are executed if and only if the given condition is true.

Comparism operators:
Operator	        Name
==	                Equal to	
!=	                Not equal	
>	                Greater than	
<	                Less than	
>=	                Greater than or equal to
<=	                Less than or equal to

Logical Operators:
Operator	    Name	                Description	
&& 	            Logical and	            Returns true if both statements are true
|| 	            Logical or	            Returns true if one of the statements is true
!	            Logical not	            Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true

Switch statements:
A more efficient alternative to using many 'else if' statements. It allows a avlue to be tested for equality againsts many cases.
-The switch expression is evaluated once
-The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
-If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
-The break statement breaks out of the switch block and stops the execution
-The default statement is optional, and specifies some code to run if there is no case match

Functions:
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

Arguments and Parameter:
Parameter- Information can be passed to functions as a parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the function.
Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma:
Arguments- An argument is referred to the values that are passed within a function when the function is called. These values are generally the source of the function that require the arguments during the process of execution. These values are assigned to the variables in the definition of the function that is called.

Return statement:
A return statement ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function. Execution resumes in the calling function at the point immediately following the call. A return statement can return a value to the calling function
The void keyword, used in the previous examples, indicates that the function should not return a value. If you want the function to return a value, you can use a data type (such as int or float, etc.) instead of void, and use the return keyword inside the function:

Tenary operator:
There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements.

 Function prototype: A funtion decleration without a body, before main()
 NB: Many C compiler do not check for parameter matching
     Missing argumenents will result in unexpected bahaviour 
A function prototyes causes the compiler to flag an error if the arguments are missing.
Advantage of function prototype
1. Easier to navigate a program w/ main() at the top
2. Helps with debugging
3. Commonly used in header files

String function:
	Function	                            Description
    strlen(string_name)                     returns the length of string name.
    strcpy(destination, source)             copies the contents of source string to destination string.
	strcat(first_string, second_string)     concats or joins first string with second string. The result of the string is stored in first string.
	strcmp(first_string, second_string)     compares the first string with second string. If both strings are same, it returns 0.
	strrev(string)                          returns reverse string.
	strlwr(string)                          returns string characters in lowercase.
	strupr(string)                          returns string characters in uppercase.

For loop: It repeats a section of code a limiited amount of times
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

while loop: It repeats a section of code possibly unlimited times; while some condition remains true. A while loop might not executr at all.

Do while-loop: it always execute a block of code once, then checks a condition.

Continue and break
countinue: It skips the rest pof code & forces the next iteration of the loop 
break: it exits a loop/switch

Array:
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].
To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces{}

To access an array element, refer to its index number.
Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.
This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers

2D Array: an array, where each element is an entire array. Useful if you need a matrix, grid, or table of data.

Stucture(struct):
It is a collection of related members ("Variable"). Thay can be of different data types. They are listed under one name in a block of momery. It is very similar to clases in other languaes (but not methods)
Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.
Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different data types (int, float, char, etc.).

To access the structure, you must create a variable of it.
Use the struct keyword inside the main() method, followed by the name of the structure and then the name of the structure variable.

Typedef: reserved keyword that gives an existing datatype a nickname

Enums: The enum in C is also known as the enumerated type. It is a user-defined data type that consists of integer values, and it provides meaningful names to these values. The use of enum in C makes the program easy to understand and maintain. The enum is defined by using the enum keyword.
The following is the way to define the enum in C

Random number: A set of value or element that are statistically random(Dont use these for any sort of cryptographic security)

BITWISE OPERATION: special operatore used in bit level programming (Knowing binary is important for this topic)

& = AND
| = OR
^ = XOR
<< = left shift
>> = right shift

Memory:
memory: an array of bytes within RAM(street)
memory block : a single unit (byte) within memory, used to hold some value (person)
memory address: When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable.(house address)

The memory address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.
When we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory address.
To access it, use the reference operator (&), and the result will represent where the variable is stored

Note: The memory address is in hexadecimal form (0x..). You probably won't get the same result in your program.
You should also note that &myAge is often called a "pointer". A pointer basically stores the memory address of a variable as its value. To print pointer values, we use the %p format specifier.

Pointer: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.
A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator(indirectional operator- Value at address). The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer

Advantage of using pointer:
1. Less time in program execution.
2. Working on the original variable.
3. with the help of pointers, we can create data structures(linked-list, stack, queue).
4. Returning more than one values from functions.
5. Researching and sorting large data very easily.
4. Dynamically memory allocation

C writing files :
 w- write
 a- append
 remove("test.txt")- delete

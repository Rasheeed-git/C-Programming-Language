Introduction to C programming language

C is a middile level language which was originated in the 197's

Advantage of a middle level language:
- They can act as a bridge as a high level software and a low level hardware.
- most compilers, kernels and operating system are written in C.
- C is the mother language of python, java, C#, C++ and jaascript

Note:
- C is not an object oriented language
- C++ is an extension of C
- C is difficult

what do you need to start C
- IDE(Text Editor)
- GCC compiler(it convert C code to machine codes)

For extention:
- Install C/C++
- Code runner

you should start with this on your environment before coding
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdbool.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<math.h>

vairable:

it is an allocated space to store variable.
steps: declerations and initialization.

There are 4 primary date types in C program

1. Integer – We use these for storing various whole numbers, such as 5, 8, 67, 2390, etc.

2. Character – It refers to all ASCII character sets as well as the single alphabets, such as ‘x’, ‘Y’, etc.

3. Double – These include all large types of numeric values that do not come under either floating-point data type or integer data type.

4. Floating-point – These refer to all the real number values or decimal points, such as 40.1, 820.673, 5.9, etc.

5. Void – This term refers to no values at all. We mostly use this data type when defining the functions in a program.

Various keywords are used in a program for specifying the data types mentioned above. Here are the keywords that we use:

Keyword Used	Data Type
int	            Integer
float	        Floating-point
void	        Void
char	        Character
double	        Double

Other data types:
bool            boolean

Format Specifier %:
Defines and formats a type of data to be displayed

Constant: it is a fixed value that cannot be altered by the program during its execution

Arithmetic operator:
Operator	Meaning of Operator
+	        addition or unary plus
-	        subtraction or unary minus
*	        multiplication
/	        division
%	        remainder after division (modulo division)
--          decrement
++          increment

Augumented assignment: it is used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable. e.g x= x+1, x+=1
